Chris Vidas has served in numerous capacities within academic libraries at different institutions throughout a career that has spanned more than twenty years. During that time, he has witnessed dramatic changes in academia, libraries, and methods for managing resources within technical services departments. He will share numerous insights into methods for advancing one's career by offering details surrounding his own experiences, observations of peer development, and advice based upon service on a broad range of search committees. This session should appeal to students considering a future in academic libraries, staff members seeking a professional library position, or experienced librarians looking for opportunities to advance their careers. In recognition of OVGTSL's one hundred year history, Chris will also discuss some of the significant developments witnessed in technical service roles and the rapidity with which those changes are currently unfolding.
