Data-driven decision making is a valuable and necessary tool for weeding collections. However, it is not a magic wand that can solve all of our weeding problems. In fact, it has some unique challenges of its own (such as your data lying to you!). This presentation will focus on the pros and cons of taking a primarily data-driven approach to large scale weeding projects. The presenters will share their experiences using data approaches during major weeding projects in academic libraries necessitated by (1) the closure of a large subject-specific branch library and (2) a large scale weeding project resulting from the discontinuation of using an offsite storage solution. Through sharing practical real-world project examples, attendees will learn ways to leverage data methods in their weeding projects and become aware of potential challenges they may face. This presentation will cover all material types but mainly focus on monographs and serials.
