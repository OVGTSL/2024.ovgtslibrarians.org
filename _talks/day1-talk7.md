The process of finding and accessing materials through libraries has evolved significantly over the last few decades. Historically, if patrons couldn’t find the needed title in the library catalog, they needed to explore other options. One such possibility was the interlibrary loan service (ILL), which allowed for loans or copies of requested materials to be supplied by other institutions. However, with the advent of electronic resources and the rethinking methods to add to library collections, patrons have more options to acquire the needed materials.

The University of Kentucky Libraries has had its own trajectory in advancing our approaches and amenities. While these standard resources and services are still available, looking to meet the users’ needs as efficiently and as quickly as possible is a continual priority. Today, the speakers will be discussing the catalog being more than a listing of holdings and the ILL service changing beyond its traditional service model. With the recent addition of Article Galaxy Scholar, patrons can now acquire needed materials without the libraries mediating access as much on their behalf. Additionally, there will be explanations around the implementation of this service, how it supplements our existing bundle of expedited delivery services, and how it is being used by patrons and assessed by the University of Kentucky Libraries.
