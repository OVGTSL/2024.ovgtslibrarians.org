Academic librarians have devoted decades to refining the methods and practices for collection development, which involves engaging faculty and departments in the material selection process. At Murray State University Libraries, a dedicated fund is allocated for each program of study for collection development. Faculty members, chosen by the chair of each department, are responsible for making purchase recommendations. However, the effectiveness of these department representatives varies across programs, influenced by previous levels of faculty involvement and understanding of collection development and library practice. 

To enhance and promote the effectiveness of the program, we have modified the onboarding process for new departmental selectors and developed basic guidelines for them. This presentation outlines the process of drafting these guidelines, challenges faced during implementation, revisions made to the guidelines, and recommendations for others undertaking similar initiatives.
