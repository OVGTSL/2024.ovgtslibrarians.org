Ronda L. Sewald, Interim Head of Area Studies Cataloging and Cartographic Resources Cataloger for Indiana University Libraries, will discuss her experiences working with cataloging backlogs for IUâ€™s Area Studies Collections written in non-Latin scripts. Combining management and cataloging perspectives, Ronda will explore factors to consider when assessing and triaging a cataloging backlog of foreign language materials as well as how these factors may impact the selection of overall strategies such as outsourcing or hiring temporary staff. Tips and tricks will be offered for how to get the cataloging work done in-house, particularly when outsourcing or hiring new staff prove to be nonviable options. Additionally, Ronda will touch briefly upon languages currently requiring better community-wide solutions to ensure that materials in these languages receive the level of description necessary for supporting user discovery. This session will be particularly useful for librarians and staff responsible for cataloging a wide range of languages as well as managers who need to ensure coverage of materials in languages that extend beyond their current in-house expertise.
