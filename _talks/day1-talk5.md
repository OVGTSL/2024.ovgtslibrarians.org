With standards and vocabularies in a state of flux, it can seem daunting to start cataloging training for staff. However, with local documentation, OhioNET's archive of online workshops, and a plan, it is possible!

The University of Akron had a backlog of several hundred un-cataloged Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs), and retirements and attrition reduced full-time cataloging staff so that progress on this project was slowing. Hear how we trained several staff from different functional areas to help and what they learned from their new cataloging experience in this panel.

We will describe the process of harvesting metadata from the OhioLINK ETD Center and preparing stub MARC records as well as the training plan and peer review process for continuous improvement. Our trainees will describe their experiences, and weâ€™ll share the lessons learned. This will be a panel presentation followed by Q&A.
