## Ohio Valley Group of Technical Services Librarians 2024 Conference
 
#### A Century of OVGTSL: Technical Services in the Past, Present, and Future
 
##### May 22-24, 2024 — Dublin, OH
 
In 1924, the Ohio Valley Group of Technical Services Librarians (OVGTSL) held its first meeting in Ohio. For 99 years, technical services librarians from Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky have met to discuss changing standards in the profession and their effect on local, regional, and national practices. OVGTSL’s centennial meeting will be held May 22-24, 2024 at The Conference Center at OCLC in Dublin, Ohio with an opening reception at The Ohio State University’s Thompson Library in Columbus. At the OVGTSL 2024 Conference, we wish to highlight a century of creative approaches to meeting challenges in technical services among Ohio Valley libraries, including electronic resources, acquisitions, cataloging and metadata, open access initiatives, serials, and more. In taking stock of our past, we can not only appreciate how far we have come in our important work, we can also find inspiration in the work of our predecessors to continue moving forward.
 
In addition to our typical request for proposals that focus on workflows and practices that you are using in your libraries today, we are especially interested in showcasing presentations on technical services topics with a historical perspective.
 
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
 
- Sources of inspiration
- DEI
- Cross-departmental collaboration and beyond
- Emerging trends in discovery and access
- Data-driven decision making
- Tools and processes for large-scale editing of metadata (OpenRefine, MarcEdit, etc.)
- Open access, including open educational resources
- Primary resources and rare collections
- Electronic resources lifecycle management
- Evolving technical services workflows
- Training and supporting staff
- Department reorganization
- Collection assessment
- Large scale weeding projects
- Print and/or acquisitions management
- Work-life balance
 
The sessions will be on May 23 and 24, 2024. Time slots for all sessions are 50 minutes, including time for questions 
from the audience. Submissions for presentations, panel discussions, lightning rounds, workshops, posters, and other 
formats are welcome.
 
The conference will be hybrid so the audience can attend in person or virtually. The presenters will attend onsite at 
the Dublin conference. The sessions will be recorded for registrants to access for two months after the conference.
